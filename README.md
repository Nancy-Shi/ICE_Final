# ICE_Final
We share the code and output for each of the pairwise or hyper-edge curves for the information single-layer model. The final plot in the paper combines these curves in a single plot.
The other ipynb files are for the main 3-layer model used to get the simulation outputs. We also share the csv output for the heatmaps. 
Figures in the manuscript are plotted in Matlab using the outputs from the python model.
