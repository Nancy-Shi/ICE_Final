# ICE_Final
final code for figures
The Figure 3 folder contains the code and raw output for each of the pairwise or hyper-edge curves. The final plot in the paper combines these curves in a single plot.
The Figure 5 folders contain the model output data of 200 simulations for each alpha and lambda value. The dataset was recorded such that each pairs of rows represent one simulations, with the top row for time and the bottom row for number of recovered at that time. 
The Model Diagrams folder contains the figure 1 and figure 2 output. 
The ipynb files are the main model code used to get the simulation output.
