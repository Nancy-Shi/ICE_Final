# ICE_Final
We share the code and output for each of the pairwise or hyper-edge curves for the information layer model. The final plot in the paper combines these curves in a single plot.
The ipynb files are the main model code used to get the simulation outputs. We also share the csv output for the zeta_2/zeta_4 heatmaps. 
Figures in the manuscript are plotted in Matlab using the outputs from the python model.
