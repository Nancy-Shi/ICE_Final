# ICE_Final
final code for figures
The Figure 4 folder contains the code and raw output for each of the pairwise or hyper-edge curves. The final plot in the paper combines these curves in a single plot.
The Model Diagrams folder contains the figure 1 and figure 2 output. 
The ipynb files are the main model code used to get the simulation output.
