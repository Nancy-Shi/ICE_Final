# ICE_Final
We share the code and output for each of the pairwise or hyper-edge curves for the information layer model. The final plot in the paper combines these curves in a single plot.
The ipynb files are the main model code used to get the simulation outputs. Other scenarios are based on the main code and changing parameter values.
Figures in the manuscript are plotted in Matlab using the outputs from the python model.
